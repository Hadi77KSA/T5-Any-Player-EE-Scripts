# T5-Any-Player-EE-Scripts
This mod makes the Easter Eggs of the Black Ops maps Ascension, Shangri-La, and Moon possible with any number of players. For Ascension and Shangri-La, the modifications were made to match the changes applied by the [Solo Easter Eggs mod for BO3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1944930083).

## Installation
1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/Hadi77KSA/T5-Any-Player-EE-Scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the `any_player_ee` folder from the zip file that was downloaded.
3. Move the `any_player_ee` folder to the correct directory:
    - For [Game_Mod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod/releases), install to `BO1_GAME_FOLDER\mods`
    - For Plutonium, follow their guide for T5: https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/loading-mods/#loading-mods--custom-zombies-maps-for-bo1
4. Start the game and select the mod from the in-game `Mods` menu.

### Alternative Installation for Plutonium
- Follow steps 1 & 2 from the main installation instructions.
- Go to `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t5` by pressing Win+R then pasting the mentioned path then press OK.
- Open the `any_player_ee` folder and copy the `maps` and `scripts` folders from inside of it.
- Paste the `maps` and `scripts` folders into the `t5` folder.

This makes the mod load automatically instead of having to select it from in-game.

## Features
### Ascension
#### Space Monkeys Round Buttons
Requires only as many buttons as there are players instead of all.

#### Lunar Lander Letters
On solo, does not require the player to be riding the lander to be able to collect the letters.  
On co-op, this step is unchanged.

#### Damaging the Orb
On solo, the Matryoshka Dolls are not required. However, the rest of the weapons are required, which are: Gersh Device, Zeus Cannon (upgraded Thunder Gun),  Porter's X2 Ray Gun (upgraded Ray Gun).  
On co-op, this step is unchanged.

### Shangri-La
#### Entering Eclipse
Requires pushing only as many buttons as there are players instead of all.

#### Matching Tiles Puzzle
On solo, requires walking over all tiles on the side where the button for making the tiles appear is to complete the step.  
On co-op, this step is unchanged.

#### Water Slide
On solo, the player is only required to go down the water slide.  
On co-op, requires all players except one to be at the bottom of the water slide standing on the pressure plate, then the remaining player to go down the slide while the rest are on the pressure plate.

### Moon
The Vril Generator is given to the player playing as Richtofen regardless of the number of players and regardless of the completions of the previous maps' Easter Eggs.  
Additionally, on solo, the player will always spawn as Richtofen.
